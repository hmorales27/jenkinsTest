        <ol>
            
            <li style="font-size:12pt;">If you are currently a subscriber to the journal, you can log in using the same username/email and password combination you use to access the journal content on the journal's web site.</li>
            
            <li style="font-size:12pt;">You can purchase issues or an annual subscription through the Apple iTunes Store.</li>
