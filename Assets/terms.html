        <p class="noindent2">Elsevier grants to you a non-transferable, non-exclusive and revocable license to install one copy of the App on your Apple Device and use the App according to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The App is licensed, not sold, to you. Except as expressly granted by this Agreement or otherwise by Elsevier or its licensors in writing, you acquire no right, title or license in the App or any data, software, content, application or materials accessed from or incorporated in the App. This Agreement does not give you any rights to any updates or upgrades to the App or to any maintenance releases, patches, fixes, extensions or enhancements (collectively, &#8220;Updates&#8221;) to the App developed by Elsevier or its suppliers or licensors at any time in the future. Except as required under applicable law, this license does not entitle you to receive any maintenance or support services with respect to the App. Elsevier may provide Updates and/or support. If provided by Elsevier, Updates may be delivered automatically or you may be notified when a new Update is ready to be installed, or we make such Updates available for download. You authorize Elsevier to deliver automatically any Update if we believe it is necessary to provide for the continued functionality of the App or for any reasonable business purpose. Your use of the Updates will be governed by this Agreement unless you are asked to agree to new or additional terms at the time of download or installation. You also agree that you may have to enter into a renewed version of this Agreement if you want to download, install or use a new or modified version of the App. </p>
